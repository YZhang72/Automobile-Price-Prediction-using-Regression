# Automobile-Price-Prediction-using-Regression
Our analysis is related to predicting the price of an automobile. 
We used the dataset from the UCI database “1985 Auto Imports Database”; 
this dataset has multivariate characteristics and includes 26 variables that consist of both categorical and numerical attributes (Schlimmer, 1987). 
Our goal is to determine which regression algorithm best predicts the price attribute. 
The prediction of price is important for customers as the price is one of the most important facts when buying a car. 
Additionally, for companies to make the best possible judgment on setting prices they need to know 
what variables are related to customers willing to pay for higher prices.
